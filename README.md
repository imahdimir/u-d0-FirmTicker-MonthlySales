# ToDo

- Complete Patterns
- Get Cleaner data by reading the quantity & price
    - Find real zero sales and not real ones
- Read PDFs, some data are only in reports
- not all monthly sales reports are the first table in the corresponding html
  page
    - so the table headers must be read and added to pattern check
- the excel output of monthly reports are some real excels some are a polished
  and
  cleaned html, reading data from them may require fewer patterns.
